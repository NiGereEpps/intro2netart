## day 2

watch [Hyperland](https://archive.org/details/DouglasAdams-Hyperland), this BBC doc form 1990 is written by && stars Douglas Adams (author of A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy), it's a history of "hypermedia" released just before the World Wide Web took off, ie. just before anyone had any real experience w/hypermedia (that serendipitous timing makes this a unique historical artifact). The the film itself is a single-channel linear video, it tries to present the viewer w/what a hypermedia experience is like through the film's aesthetic (which is also a very tasty 90's aesthetic). quite the gem. (the link above is to the doc hosted on the [Internet Archive](https://vimeo.com/59207751) but if u have trouble viewing it there u can also find it on YouTube)

Watch the [Form Art Video](https://youtu.be/N0KpmV9CDfg) && complete the form art experiment.

## day 3

**(HOLIDAY - Martin Luther King Jr. - NO CLASS)**

## day 4

watch the three videos in the **Geocities** section of the class notes on [Netizens: Online Communities && Digital Folklore ](https://github.com/nbriz/intro2netart/blob/master/notes/netizens/README.md) (optionally peruse the One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age blog +  read Olia Lialina's "Vernacular Web" essays, quoted && linked in those notes). Then read the main page of the [CSS class notes](https://github.com/nbriz/intro2netart/blob/master/notes/css/README.md) as well as the [introduction page](https://github.com/nbriz/intro2netart/blob/master/notes/css/basics.md) (refer to the other sections when u need 'em)

watch the [intro to CSS video](https://youtu.be/q71m_mHGSDw) && complete the CSS Art experiment.

## day 5

Watch [Aunauthorized Access](https://archive.org/details/UnauthorizedAccess). This doc is a gem! made in 1994 by Annaliza Savage, she traveled to 15 cities in four countries to record the stories of notorious hackers (&& hacker culture) in that era. Not the DIY home-brew tinkier sort of hacker (like the kind u meet at hack-a-thon or makerspace) but the "black hoodie" breaking into systems sort of hacker. Though illegal, this was a time before the "[Cyberwar](https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/cyberwar)" era we're in now, most of these hackers weren't paid, they weren't after money, they did what they did either for political/activist reasons, or for the challenge, or sometimes just for fun.

watch my [CSS Wed Design + Layout](https://youtu.be/9S0xxJhRI-E ) tutorial && complete the home-page redesign experiment.


## day 6

[Cyberpunk](https://archive.org/details/cyberpunk_201410): this 1990 doc by Marianne Trench about the cyberpunk culture is hella 90s (the aesthetic is to die for). Goes into all things cyberpunk from Virtual Reality to "cyber arts" to mind machines. some great interviews in this one, including William Gibson (author && father of cyberpunk), to Timothy Leary (the notorious LSD evangelist) to Jaron Lanier (VR pioneer turned digital rights advocate). Quite a gem.

watch my [WebVR tutorial](https://youtu.be/0OAtOwGXz4s) && compete the WebVR experiment.


## day 7

watch the following videos about life in the Internet age ...TBD...

then begin work on ur final project: this will be a net art piece (in the broadest sense) in which u consider more deeply what it means to have a "presence" online && comment on life in the Internet age. rather than creating a profile on a social media account, what we want to ask ourselves is: given a blank canvas what do we want to say/do/express on the web. while the piece can be auto-biographical, it shouldn't be a "portfolio" or "profile" (consider Olia Lialina's distinctions between the old days of "My" vs the current state of "Me"). while u can draw aesthetic inspiration from anything u see on/off line, the style of ur piece should not be concerned w/following any particular set of web design conventions, but should instead serve the interest of the message/question/ideas ur attempting to articulate in ur piece.

This project also serves as a test for the various technical skills covered in class (HTML, CSS, etc). i will be considering the following technical aspects of ur piece when evaluating ur work:

- Is the work accessible on the web (either through the default ghpages URL or your own custom URL)?
- Is the code written correctly with proper syntax? Is it properly indented? Are the HTML elements and CSS classes in the right place?
- Is your project organized modularly? ex: CSS && HTML in separate files? are media assets (images, videos, audio) stored in their own directories? etc.
- Did you follow the proper file naming conventions? (is there an index.html page? are folder/file names written w/out spaces && lower case?)
- Is any borrowed (copy+pasted) code properly attributed? Are there other helpful comments

by next week u should have at the very least started a project on ur GitHub account (ie. a new "repository") w/an `index.html` file in it as well as a `css/styles.css` file. send me the URL to this repo before class next week. the final will be due on **March 09** (the second to last week of class).
