<!-- this is the "DOCYTPE" a declaration that tells ur browser that the code -->
<!-- that follows conforms to the standards of a particular version of HTML, -->
<!-- these used to be long && complicated but with the latest version of -->
<!-- HTML (HTML5) its now short && sweet. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- after that we've got our first official element, <html> the opening tag  -->
<!-- indicates that everything in between it && the closing </html> is going to  -->
<!-- be HTML code. the lang="en" attribute let's the browser know that the -->
<!-- page's contents is going to be in "english". -->

<!-- inside of the HTML element there are two major elements,  -->
<!-- the <head> ... </head> which contains information about the page,  -->
<!-- && the <body> ... </body> which contains everything that  -->
<!-- will show up inside the browser window. -->
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- the only thing we absolutely need inside of our head element is  -->
    <!-- a <title> Page Title </title>. u won't see this inside ur browser window  -->
    <!-- (b/c its not in the body) but will show up in lots of other places  -->
    <!-- for example on ur browser tab, && also in google search results. -->
    <title>Introduction to Internet Art: University of Chicago</title>

    <!-- this one is for the author of the page -->

    <!-- the <center> tag is now considered "obsolete" or "depreciated" -->
    <!-- these kind of "layout" details are now defined in CSS, so it's best to -->
