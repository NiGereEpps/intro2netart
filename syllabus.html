      <h2>Course Description</h2>

      <p>
        This studio course examines the Internet as an artistic medium (computers, networks and code), as an environment (media ecology) and as "the masterpiece of human civilization" (à la Virginia Heffernan). Our focus will be on producing creative contributions to this collaborative space by learning the core coding languages of the web, HTML and CSS. While we will occasionally be discussing the contributions of self-identified artists (from the net.art movement of the 1990s for example) we will generally be taking a broader cultural view, exploring the histories, philosophies and practices of various online cultural niches. We will learn how hackers use the command line to break into networks and how the open source community use special tools that facilitate large scale collaborations. We'll learn about AI praised by singularity evangelists in the "age of spiritual machines" as well as the digital rights activists who protest against the algorithms of surveillance capitalism. Throughout this journey, we will be learning the craft of the Internet, and in particular browsers and the web. We will be borrowing techniques from demoscensters, meme-makers, cyberpunks and web designers as we learn to produce work with the web's generalized media format (HTML and CSS) as well as how to distribute that work online (deploying web sites).
      </p>

      <h3>class participation</h3>

      <p>
        <b>class discussions</b>: So much of what we’re going to cover in class, both in terms of the theory and practice, can be gleaned through your own online research. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of learning this material in the classroom, rather than on your own, is the chance for realtime interactivity with your professor and peers. I can not stress enough how important it is to take advantage of class discussions. In order to fully participate in these discussions you must be present, on time and attentive. You must also complete any/all readings (or videos/podcasts) assigned for homework as well as maintain good notes (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>notes</b>: You will be expected to keep organized notes throughout the quarter. These can be written down in a physical notebook (ex: grid-paper journal mentioned in the class materials section above) or in a digital document on your computer (as long as you bring it to class). In addition to the obvious/general notes taken in class during lectures or at home during your own research/experimentation time, there is one very important type of notes I will be expecting you to bring to class on a weekly basis: <b>questions</b>. Any thoughts/curiosities, whether technical or theoretical, based on a homework assignment or generally related to the subjects covered in class should be written down in your notes. Maybe there were references made in a reading assignment you didn’t understand and had a hard time looking up yourself? Maybe someone shared an article on social media about a data leak or online surveillance you don’t fully understand? Maybe there’s a bug you keep getting and can’t seem to find the solution for online? Write them all down and bring these to class. That said, if at any point you are having an issue (say with a homework assignment) that’s private/personal or otherwise can’t wait for a class you are of course encouraged to email me (nbriz@uchicago.edu) at any point throughout the quarter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>attendance</b>: It should go without saying that you can't participate in class discussions if you are not present in class. If a student arrives to class late or leaves early it will be considered a half absence. Students should miss class only with reasonable cause. If a student needs to miss class with reasonable cause, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the professor before the date of the class being missed to receive instruction for how to make up for the missed class. Unexcused absences are not permitted, this means if the student misses a class for anything other than a reasonable cause (communicated prior to the absence) the student will fail the class. If a student misses MORE than three (excused) classes, the student will fail the class. Reasonable cause to miss a class might include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Illness or hospitalization (the student should contact Health Services, who will relay information to the faculty in whose class the student is enrolled)
          </li>
          <li>
            Family illness or death
          </li>
          <li>
            Professional opportunities (should be communicated to the professor && approved ahead of time)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>www experiments</h3>

      <p>
        You will be completing a series of code experiments throughout the quarter (before shifting focus onto the final project). The specifics of these experiments will depend on the technical literacy of the students enrolled in the class and the speed at which we cover the material. But for context, these may include: a hypertext bio, CSS still life, “Form Art” portraits, “Pure CSS” drawings, virtual online environment (3D/VR). Details for how to submit each assignment will be explained in the class website (when in doubt send it to me via email).
      </p>

      <h3>net art statement (final)</h3>

      <p>
        For the final project you will be creating an net artist statement in the form of a website. The goal​ of this final project is to consider more deeply what it means to have a "presence" online, to critically examine aesthetic conventions on the web and to generally comment on life in the Internet age. This project also serves as a test for the various technical skills covered in class (HTML, CSS, etc). We will be discussing this project in more detail towards the end of the quarter.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be hosting your final project on your ​github​ account (accessible online via ​ghpages​), this will be due​ by the end of the quarter, at which point I will be considering the following when evaluating​ your final submissions:
        <ul>
          <li>Is the work accessible on the web (either through the default ghpages URL or your own custom URL)?</li>
          <li>Is the code written correctly with proper syntax?</li>
          <li>Is your project organized modularly?</li>
          <li>Did you follow the proper file naming conventions?</li>
          <li>Are the HTML elements and CSS classes in the right place?</li>
          <li>Is it properly indented?</li>
          <li>Are there helpful comments?</li>
          <li>Is any borrowed (copy+pasted) code properly attributed?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Materials and Supplies</h2>

      <p>
        Students are expected to bring their laptops to class every week. Students are also expected to have downloaded and installed the following applications by the second week of class: the <a href="https://atom.io/" target="">Atom</a> code editor (or another code editor of their choice, ex: <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>) as well as the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> web browser (though it's always a good idea to have multiple web browsers installed like <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://www.opera.com/" target="_blank">Opera</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        All readings, watchings && listenings will be provided by the professor. Notes and resources will be available on the <a href="http://netart.rocks/uchicago">class website</a>. It is also recommended that you purchase a grid-paper notebook (though it is not required, see the "notes" section above)
      </p>


      <h2>the MAAD Center</h2>

      <p>
        The MADD Center consists of five member labs, including two labs run by Arts Technologies: <a href="http://hal.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">the Hack Arts Lab (HAL)</a> and <a href="http://westongamelab.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">the Weston Game Lab (WGL)</a>. HAL resources include 3D printers, laser cutters, a vinyl cutter, a desktop CNC router, soldering stations and other micro-electronics tools, as well as a digital embroidery machine and a creative and helpful student staff. WGL resources include video game consoles from the late 1970s to the present (with an accompanying collection of games housed in the library one floor below) and an ever-growing collection of tabletop games, as well as resources for analog and digital game and interactive art development. The two labs share a space, PC and HTC Vive Wireless headsets dedicated to virtual reality play and development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another MADD member lab, <a href="http://cs.csil.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">CSIL (Computer Science Instructional Laboratory)</a> contains dozens of Mac computer workstations, with software including Adobe CC and many other programs for graphic design, audio and video editing, CAD/3D modeling and animation, and more. CSIL labs are general access when not reserved for classes, and its outboard Mac stations are available anytime the John Crerar Library is open (8am-midnight Sun-Thurs, 8am-10pm Fri-Sat).
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to these technological and recreational resources, the Arts Labs at MADD offer an expansive workspace with wonderful natural light and numerous butcher block worktables.
      </p>

      <p>
        The space itself is open to anyone; no formal orientation is required. Access to most the resources listed above is facilitated through a Canvas course, where there’s a simple policy quiz, and additional quizzes and/or tutorials for access to and instruction on other tools. No in-person orientation session is required. Access to the Canvas course can be requested in person at the MADD Center Front Desk, or by sending an email to madd<i></i>center@uch<i></i>icago.edu. We also use the Canvas course to post announcements about events, such as demos and talks by visiting artists and scholars (e.g. real-time video artist Nick Ciontea on January 10, digital media and videogame scholar Kishonna Gray on January 17).
