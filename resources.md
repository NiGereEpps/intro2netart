## software

All the software we'll be using in class is free + open source. that's great cause we don't have to pay for stuff, but the benefits of open source software has less to do w/finances than it does other stuff (we'll be talking about this later in the semester).

#### Code Editor

The first thing u'll need is a Code Editor. When u "code" it just means u're creating a text file like any other, except that the language u're writing in isn't English, Spanish or French, it's a computer programming language. This means any app that lets u type text into it can be used to write code. That said, just like there are editors that come w/extra features to make it easier to write in English (for example Microsoft Word which has spell-check + grammar-check) there are editors that come w/extra features to make it easier to write code. The one we'll be using in class is called [Atom](https://atom.io/). We'll be using Atom for a few reasons besides the fact that it's open source, but there are some other great Code Editors out there too, like [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) && [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (if u already prefer one of these that's ok, but keep in mind i will be using Atom exclusively during lectures).

#### HTTP Client (aka WWWeb Browser)

We'll also need an web client (aka a browser), because we'll be predominately writing code meant to be viewed "online" we need a browser to view our work in. Browsers also come w/built-in developer tools which help to debug && inspect the code we write, the browser we'll be using in class is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). U should actually download as many browsers as u can, we'll be using Firefox, but it's important to test ur work on other browsers b/c u never know what browser ur audience is going to be using, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) or Edge (or worse, Safari or Internet Explorer).

## books

You DO NOT need to purchase any books for class, as mentioned in the syllabus all readings/videos/notes will be provided on the class website. that said, for folks interested in augmenting this course w/books i'd recommend [HTML and CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) by Jon Duckett, a beautifully designed book for learning to code HTML and CSS, [Internet Art](https://archive.org/details/internetart00gree) by Rachel Greene a pretty comprehensive history of early net art (check out her  essay from ArtForum [Web Work: A History of Internet Art](http://netart.rocks/files/webwork.pdf) for a "cliff notes" version) and the [The Art Happens Here: Net Art Anthology](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Happens-Here-Net-Anthology/dp/0692173080?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-d-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0692173080) by rhizome (which is also available in an [online version](https://anthology.rhizome.org/))

## tutorials && code help/references

The Internet is full of HTML && CSS tutorials and references, but the best (in mine opinion) can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), MDN has a whole [set of tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) for learning web development as well as references for [HTML elements && attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) as well as [CSS selectors && properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference). W3schools is another popular (though kinda old + a bit outdated in my opinion) site with [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) && [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) tutorials.

I'll be using [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) throughout the quarter to demo small examples as well as to share code snippets w/students via email (when asked specific code questions)

Last but not least u'll need to sign up for [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com/), which is arguably the largest online forum of coders helping other coders code. If u're ever stuck trying to code something, someone has either already asked + answered whatever question u have on StackOverflow && in the rare occasion that they haven't, u can ask a question urself && in minutes u'll have an answer (it's that good!). But u need to be careful, StackOverflow, like any community has it's own social norms, if u break these norms people get mad && won't help, but if u follow them other folks will literally compete to write ur code for u! We'll be discussing how to properly engage w/this community in class.
